Python API Weather Application
The purpose of this project is to create Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator using the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities. In the second part of the project, user weather preferences are captured and then matched to hotels across the word that match said weather preferences using Google Places API.
